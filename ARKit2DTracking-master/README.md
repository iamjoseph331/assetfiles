# ARKit2DTracking


## Overview

This demo project shows a rough implementation of 2D tracking using Apple's ARKit.

This project will recognize QR codes and place a Virtual 3D cup on the QR code. Moving the QR code moves the cup.

Try playing with the hit test types to see different results.

I used Apple's ARKit sample project from WWDC as a starter point. This is also where the 3D model is from. You can view that project here: https://developer.apple.com/sample-code/wwdc/2017/PlacingObjects.zip
